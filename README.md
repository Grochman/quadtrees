# quadtrees
Work in progress n-body simulation. As for now the quadtree usage is my original "on peasant mind" idea.

## features
- quadtree data structure
- gravity physics simulation
- quadtree visualization

## todo
- Barnes-Hut Algorithm
- multithreading (also probably for drawing because SFML is stinky)
- gpu utilization (probably OpenCL)
- density based visualization
