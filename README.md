# quadtrees
N-body simulation. Other branches may contain (if I havenâ€™t deleted them then experimental and overengeneered) a quadtree data structure with the ability to update particle ownership without rebuilding the whole tree.

## features
- Barnes-Hut algorithm implementation
- Leapfrog integration
- quadtree visualization (SFML)
- simple multithreading (seperate barnach)

## todo
- gpu utilization (OpenCL / SYCL)
- visualization with OpenGL (better performance plus SFML does not handle transparency well - no easy way to draw fading particle trails)
- density based visualization
- exploration of different integration methods (rk4)
