# quadtrees
N-body simulation. Other branches may contain (if I havenâ€™t deleted them then experimental and overengeneered) a quadtree data structure with the ability to update particle ownership without rebuilding the whole tree.

## features
- Barnes-Hut algorithm implementation
- quadtree visualization (SFML)
- simple multithreading (seperate barnach)

## todo
- gpu utilization (probably OpenCL)
- density based visualization
